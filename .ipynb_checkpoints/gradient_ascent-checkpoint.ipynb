    "The backpropagation algorithm is one of the key ingredients for the training of neural networks, but it's also probably the most difficult concept to grasp in understanding how things really work. At least in my own experience, it's been the one thing that I've struggled to gain a deep understanding of. After juggling between a plethora of materials on the subject, I got my own eureka moment and the pieces fell into place. Like me you may also be self-taught through online courses and may have done a couple of projects but you still feel that twinge of `half-knowledge`, of only vaguely understanding what is actually going on when you are training neural networks (or any other maching learning model)."

    "Because that was the `most glossed over` bit for me. Many online courses would just tell you that backpropagation finds the `partial derivative` of the loss function with respect to the weights (ie. the gradient) and takes a step in the direction opposite to this gradient; because the **gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent**, taking a step in the opposite direction would mean we move in **the direction of steepest descent**. But they never state why, I mean the why of the why. We take a step in the direction opposite to the gradient because it points in the direction of steepest ascent but the question (for me) really is: How did the gradient get to be the direction of steepest ascent?"

    "So now we have directional derivatives which are essentially a generalization of partial derivatives to deal with any arbitrary direction in our input plane. When training neural networks, the problem we seek to solve is: given that we are at a point say `(1, 5)` which corresponds to a loss (the output of our function) of `t`, which **direction** results in the greatest increase in our loss? Once we know this **direction** we take a step in the opposite **direction** which would lead to the greatest reduction in the loss. Notice that I'm placing an intentional emphasis on the word **direction**. We are looking for the best direction and lucky enough we already have a tool that gives a measure of how good (or bad) a particular direction is, which as you may have guessed is the `directional derivative`.\n",
