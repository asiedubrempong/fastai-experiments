# fastai experiments
> I'm currently taking the ongoing (yet to be released) version of the fastai course and also reading the fastai [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) alongside. This repository contains experiments and personal projects that I would be working on as I go through the course.

We are all caught up in the middle of a global pandemic. The novel corona virus is affecting 199 countries and territories around the [world](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). Many are being encouraged to wear masks as it prevents you from spreading the virus if you're infected and also reduces the chances of contracting the virus. 

I built an image classifier to identify the different types of masks that are being used namely: N95 respirators and surgical masks. There is an increase in the use of home made masks but I wasn't able to curate a dataset of these masks.
